by ###Michael Lenort | University of Salzburg |


NES Emulator in Javascript.


This NES Simulator is entirely written in pure Javascript according to the docs that can be found on the devnes website.

This project was inspired by the class that i took at the University of Salzburg in selfie.


To get some childhood vibes, there is also a fully rendered 3D Scene written in Three.js which allows you to play your emulator in a virutal world.



Interested in seeing how to build such a thing? Check out my YouTube page where i explain how i started.


Feel free to fork, clone or download the project and do whatever you want with it.
